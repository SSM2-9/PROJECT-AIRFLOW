# Airflow 🌬️

**Airflow** is a web-based, predictive air quality application leveraging high-resolution data from NASA’s **Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO)** mission. The app provides actionable, neighborhood-level, hourly air quality forecasts across North America.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Airflow features a seamless, multi-persona user interface built around three core components:

- **Dashboard:** A data-fused interface showing real-time and historical air quality.  
- **Hourly Forecast Map:** Interactive map with a **"Time-Travel" slider** to visualize pollution plumes hour by hour.  
- **Health-First Alert System:** Sends actionable alerts, like "Limit outdoor exertion at 4 PM," based on predictive modeling.

The **Data Integration Engine** is the core innovation, fusing TEMPO’s satellite data (NO₂, O₃) with ground-based sensor readings and weather forecasts to provide validated, neighborhood-level predictions.

## 🎯 Challenge Addressed

Airflow is the **first public-facing app** to:

- Deliver validated, neighborhood-level, hourly air quality predictions.  
- Visualize pollution spread hour-by-hour using TEMPO’s geospatial advantage.  
- Provide actionable insights for sensitive populations and outdoor enthusiasts to reduce pollutant exposure.

---

## 💡 Why It Matters

By translating complex, high-volume NASA data into simple advice, Airflow empowers users to:

- Schedule outdoor activities safely.  
- Reduce exposure to harmful pollutants for sensitive groups (e.g., children with asthma, elderly).  
- Make informed public health decisions based on predictive, validated data.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** Python (Data Integration Engine)  
- **Data Sources:** NASA TEMPO satellite data, ground sensors, weather forecasts  
- **Deployment:** GitHub (source), Vercel (frontend preview, optional)
